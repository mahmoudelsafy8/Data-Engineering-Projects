# Project: Data Modeling With Postgres
---

### Introduction
---

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They had like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL ppipeline for this analysis. You will be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Skarkify and compare your results with their expected results.

---
### Project Description
---
In this project, you will apply what you have learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

---
### How to Run The Python Script
---
**1.run create_tables.py** to set up the database tables.


**2.run elt.py** to process and load the data into database.


**3-run test.ipynb** to check the example queries and validation.

---
### Database Schema
---
database schema design include one fact table 'songplays' and 4 dimension tables 'songs','users','time','artists'

### Song Dataset
---

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two filesin this dataset.
> song_data/A/B/C/TRANBCE128F424C983.json
song_data/D/S/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRANBCE128F424C983.json, looks like

> {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
---

### Log Dataset 
---
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above, These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you will be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
> log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

### Schema for Song Play Analysis
---
Using the song and log datasets, you will need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table
---

- songplays: records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong, looks like

>songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables
---

- users: users in the app, looks like

>user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

- songs: songs in the music database, looks like

>song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

- artists: artists in music database, looks like

>artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

- time: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units, looks like

>start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### Project Files
---

The project workspace includs six files:

##### 1- test.ipynb 
> displays the first few rows od each table to let you check your database.

##### 2- create_tables.py 
> drops and creates tables. You run this to reset your tables before each time you run yours ETL scripts.

##### 3- etl.ipynb 
> reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.

##### 4-elt.py
>reads and processes files from song_date and log_data and loads them into the tables. you can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.

##### 5- sql_queries.py
> cotains all your sql quesries, and is imported into the last three files above.
