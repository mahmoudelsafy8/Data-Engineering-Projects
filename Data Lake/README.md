# Project: Data Lake
---

### Introduction
---

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

I'll be able to test the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results

---
### Project Description
---
In this project, will apply what I've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, I will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. I'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS

### Database Schema
---
database schema design include one fact table 'songplays' and 4 dimension tables 'songs','users','time','artists'

### Song Dataset
---

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two filesin this dataset.
> song_data/A/B/C/TRANBCE128F424C983.json
song_data/D/S/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRANBCE128F424C983.json, looks like

> {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
---

### Log Dataset 
---
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above, These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you will be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
> log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

### Schema for Song Play Analysis
---
Using the song and log datasets, you will need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table
---

- songplays: records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong, looks like

>songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables
---

- users: users in the app, looks like

>user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

- songs: songs in the music database, looks like

>song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

- artists: artists in music database, looks like

>artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

- time: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units, looks like

>start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### Project Files
---

The project template includes three files:

##### 1- etl.py 
> reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.

##### 2- dl.cfg 
> contains your AWS credentials.

##### 3- README.md 
> provides discussion on your process and decisions.

### How to Run
---
1- Add appropriate AWS IAM Credentials in dl.cfg

2- Specify desired output data path in the main function of etl.py

3- Run etl.py
